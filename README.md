INTENDED DESIGNS:
1. We intended to display NaN when inputting a negative number for Factorials and when Dividng by 0. Our reason is that negative factorials and dividing by 0 give you an error/undefined in your calculator.
2. Should clear screen, if it doesn't it will for VScode
3. Because of the way we coded this, you only have to add the name of the function to display.options and put the method that connects to it into the corresponding Class/HashMap (IMPORTANT), then it will work.
